                    <h2>Los Angeles Dodgers</h2>
                    <p>The Dodgers landed where they usually do when the first preseason rankings of the year come out -- No. 1, based on their never-ending depth and success in the prior season. The Dodgers lost key players to free agency, 
                        including Corey Seager and Max Scherzer, but Trea Turner moving back to his natural position at shortstop should help solidify the infield situation. The Dodgers could use some starting pitching help, and they partly addressed that 
                        by reportedly re-signing one of their own, Clayton Kershaw, to a one-year deal.

                        <h2>Chicago White Sox</h2>
                        <p>When the biggest question surrounding a team is, “Will this be the year they win the World Series?” it’s easy to understand how the White Sox landed so high in the first Power Rankings of the year. The Sox do have questions to 
                            address: Who will play right field and second base? Should they add more pitching? But with most of the ’21 playoff team returning, and a solid rotation that starts with Lucas Giolito, Dylan Cease and Lance Lynn, the Sox look 
                            to be in good position to nab another AL Central title with ease.

                        <h2>Tampa Bay Rays</h2>
                        <p>The Rays are coming off the only 100-win season in their history, and, unsurprisingly, they’ll largely rely on a young, unproven group of pitchers to piece together another campaign. Ryan Yarbrough and Josh Fleming are set to 
                            return, with Yonny Chirinos and Tommy Romero hoping to help at some point. But there are others to keep an eye on: Shane McClanahan, Shane Baz, Drew Rasmussen and Luis Patiño. This group is long on talent but short on experience, 
                            the latter of which could change in ’22.

                        <h2>New York Yankees</h2>
                        <p>The Yankees have two main questions they need to answer in the short-term: Who will play shortstop? Do they have enough pitching? Their bullpen is considered a strength, but they could use at least one more starter. For now their 
                            rotation would consist of Gerrit Cole, Jordan Montgomery, Luis Severino, Nestor Cortes Jr. and Domingo Germán. Of the group, Severino is seemingly the most vulnerable, having made just seven Major League appearances since he signed 
                            a four-year contract in spring 2019.

                        <h2>New York Mets</h2>
                        <p>The Mets were among the most active teams in the free-agent market before the lockout began, and it’s unclear whether they’ll continue to add to a roster that already looks deep enough to make a push in the National League East. 
                            Manager Buck Showalter is on a long list of “new” Mets that includes Max Scherzer, outfielders Starling Marte and Mark Canha, and infielder Eduardo Escobar. The Mets would like to add another starting pitcher and a lefty reliever; 
                            the only question that remains is how much more they’re willing to spend.

                        <h2>Toronto Blue Jays</h2>
                        <p>The Blue Jays finally are in line for a full season at home, their first since 2019. Returning to Rogers Centre late in 2021 gave the club a major boost, but beyond that, there will be a relief among players that they can return to a 
                            sense of normalcy in their day-to-day lives and experience a true “home” city. Capacity limits for fans and in-stadium protocols will continue to evolve based on COVID-19 regulations in the province of Ontario and the city of Toronto.
